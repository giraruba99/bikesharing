# Bikesharing
- In this project, we used Tableau as out visualization tool and created beautiful worksheets, then dashboard and a story.

## Purpose of the Analysis
  * The main purpose of the analysis can be summarized as follows:
    - To analyze NY Citi bike program, and build an eye catching display on worksheets
    - To build a summary of those worksheets and show them in a single dashboard
    - To organize a story from our analysis and get it ready for our audiences (investors).
    - To use our NY Citi bike-sharing analysis as a basis to start a bikesharing program in Des Moines, IA.

## Analysis and Results
  * Checkout Times for Users
  - This analysis shows most of bike use is within 20 minutes of the first hour after checkout.

  * Checkout times by gender
  - In this Tableau worksheet, we found extremely high number of male bike users, followed female and unknown gender

  * Trips by Weekday per hour
  - This analysis show bike as means of commute to many people in NY city as it is more popular during rush ours

  * Trips by gender (weekday hours)
  - As expected, male users dominate the bike usage' and it is mostly during rush hour of weekdays

## Conclusion

  * Our analysis shows a clear sign of opportunity and we can show the analyzed data on tableau worksheets, dashboard and story. We found some areas of NY are more popular destinations than others, and the most popular areas are mostly where there will be a need for a lot of bike repair.

## Recommendations
  
  * Finally, we can recommend that this business can work in Des Moines too. 
  * Data wise it looks this bike-sharing can work in Des Moines, but we also recommend additional pilot study like:
   - The availability of bike lanes in Des Moines
   - The city rules that regulate bike sharing
   - Spaces where those bikes are going to park
   - Occurrence of theft and vandalization in that city
